In my homelab I have a couple servers and networking gear that I use for building out different network environments to learn about pentesting, and a little about blue team tactics. I also use my server, Nebula to host services that I use frequently use and that I would consider my "production environment". As for my other server, Pulsar I use it as a "dev environment" to test different tools, pentest, and work on projects.

Below is a more in depth view of my equipment and some of the services I host in my lab.

## 3D Printer

I purchased this cool little printer not to long ago and have had nothing but a positive experience from working with it. I usually just print toys, figurines, tools, or print broken parts. The 3D Printer in the photo below is the Creality Ender 3 Pro

There are a few modifications that I added to my printer such as the cable chain on the back side of the printer to maintain the cords from getting tangled in the heating elements. I also added a Raspberry Pi with a camera that is running OctoPi. In the WebGUI of OctoPi I can control almost all the features of the printer plus with the added camera I can view my prints when I'm away from the printer. 

## Desk and Tools

I also have a desk near by the 3D printer where I have tons of drawers all with all seperated electronic parts that I either disassembled or bought in bulk online. When I have an idea I try to sketch it out and when I get back to my lab try to assemble it or draw out a PCB to test my idea out. There are a few cool little projects that I have made and would love to share more about those in later post.
