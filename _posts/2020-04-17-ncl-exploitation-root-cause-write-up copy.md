This was my first time competing in an event like the competition hosted by the National Cyber League (NCL) and I had a lot of fun going through each of the categories from Wifi Pentesting, Network Analysis, Exploitation, Web App Security and many more. There were many tricky challenges that ranged from Easy to Hard, but the category that I found most interesting is the "Enumeration and Exploitation" category. The challenges in this category involved reverse engineering software/malware or retriving files from a machine. There was a challenge in the Spring 2020 Preseason that I really enjoyed solving called "Root Cause". During the preseason I noticed that there was around ten players that managed to solve the Root Cause problem in the beginning unlike many of the other challenges where there were many people with a 100% completion in different categories. I saw this as a chellenge and began to solve it and become one of the top players.

You are given the option between downloading either a x32 or x64 binary file to solve the problem. So my first instinct was to open the debugger of my choice and at the time I used Ghidra a tool that was developed by the NSA. I you dont already have Ghidra installed then you can go ahead follow my guide on how to install here:

Once you open Ghidra you want to start a new project and import the binary file into you project.

Now that we have loaded the file we want to Analyze it and
