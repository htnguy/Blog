I'm currently a student at the University of Louisville double majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I'm passionate about the field of Cyber Security, but more specifically the offensive security.

## School

During my time at the University of Louisville J.B. School of Engineering I am heavily involved in many activities. Some of the activities I'm involved in at school is the ACM Cyber Defense Team, working in the Computer Science and Engineering department in the data center to help support the faculty and students. In addition, I'm also a graduate teaching assistant for a Computer and Cyber Crime class at the school of Criminal Justice.

## Self Study

When I have some free time I like to spend time learning more and sharpening my skills. Here are a few platforms that I use to practice and learn different skills in the field of security: Hack-The-Box, PentesterLab, and Pentester Academey. I also have my own homelab where I build on my knowledge about virtualization, linux, networking, offensive/defensive security, and to play around with other tools and operating systems.
